A partially observable Markov model (POMM) can capture context-dependent transitions between symbols in sequences. 
For example, the syllable sequences of Bengalese finches can be described using POMMs (Jin & Kozhevnikov, PLoS Comput Biol, 2011; Lu et al., J Neurosci, 2025).
Here is the code used in Lu et al. (J Neurosci, 2025).

A POMM is a Markov transition model defined in a state space. To capture context dependence, some symbols must be represented by multiple states. 
This many-to-one mapping from states to symbols is characteristic of POMMs. 
The goal of the code is to determine the minimum number of states required for each symbol.

To run the code, first compile the C library:

     make

The state transition diagrams are plotted with GraphViz. Make sure to install it from

Then run 

     python ToyModels.py

Toy models were used to illustrate the method in Lu et al. (J Neurosci, 2025). These should provide a helpful starting point for analyzing your own data.

Useful concepts:

    State vector: S = [0, -1, 'A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'E']
    This specificies the symbol associated with each state. 
    0:  start state
    -1: end state
    In this example 'A', 'B', 'D', 'E' are associated with one state each. 'C' is associated with two states. 

    Transition probabilities P: transition probabilties between the states.
